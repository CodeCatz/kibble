#Instructions
It's really simple.

2. check if *topic folder* exists (e.g. jQuery, php, django), if not *create it*
3. inside the topic folder create a _new folder_ for your presentation in following format _year-month-day-keywords_ (see example below)
4. put your files in the folder you created
5. create/edit readme.md in the topic folder and add a short description about your kibble
5. commit and push to *your* forked repository
6. create a pull request to push to this repository
 
Example of directory structure:

 ...
```
