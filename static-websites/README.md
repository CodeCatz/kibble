> "A Static Site Generator is a program, that generates an HTML website as an output. This HTML website is then served through your web server, just like the old’n’days. This is usually achieved using template languages and code that separates out the layout of the website from its content and styles."

## Bonus: GitHub Pages

A simple way to create a static page on GitHub is by using the [automatic generator](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator).

Another way is to create project pages [manually](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually) by pushing a static website to a `gh-pages` branch.
